            Why is it important?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our oceans are the lifeblood of our planet. They produce over half of the world's oxygen, regulate our climate, and provide a home for countless species. Protecting our seas is essential for the health of our planet and future generations. By safeguarding marine ecosystems, we can ensure a sustainable supply of food, maintain biodiversity, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Let's work together to preserve the beauty and vitality of our oceans.
